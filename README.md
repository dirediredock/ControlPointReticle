# GeoreferenceRasters

Shared here is small part of my PhD project funded by a Mitacs fellowship at the Global Ocean Modelling Lab (GOM) of The University of British Columbia (UBC), in partnership with Tsleil-Waututh Nation (TWN) and engineering consultants Kerr Wood Leidal Associates (KWL), and part of TWN’s Cumulative Effects Monitoring Initiative (CEMI).

Many thanks for the support and guidance of my supervisory committee; professor Villy Christensen (UBC, GOM), Spencer Taft (TWN, CEMI project lead), Patrick Lilley (KWL, CEMI), and colleagues Meaghan Efford (GOM, CEMI) and Greig Oldford (GOM). Special thanks to Jesse Morin (UBC, CEMI), Michelle George (TWN), and Michael George (TWN) for sharing their knowledge of Tsleil-Waut’s historical changes, Evan Thornberry (UBC) for sharing geospatial archives, and Bruce Macdonald, author of ‘Vancouver: A Visual History’ for his support and for trailblazing the historical landscape reconstruction of the region. This project unfolded through remote work between April 2020 and April 2021 at Musqueam, Squamish, Tsleil-Waututh, and Sto:lo unceded territories of Canada, and Mapuche, Kaweskar, and Selk'nam lands of Chile.
